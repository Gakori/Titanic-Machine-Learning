## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 Titanic ML is a dataset from kaggle thattries to investigate different factors that may lead to survival rates of passangers in titanic. During analysis, feature engineering is considered to create any new features during the analysis. We create machine learning models to predict whether the passangers survived or did not.
 the different machine learning models put into cosideration are:
  Random forest
  Decision tree
  Logistic regression
  Linear Support Vector Machine
  Gaussian Naive Bayes  etc
 All this are used to detrmine the best model
